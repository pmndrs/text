/**
 * Host-agnostic Slug shader core. Adapted from three-flatland Slug at 2935a89f (MIT).
 *
 * Every function here is a TypeGPU shader function over plain values, so the fill
 * algorithm is shared by any WebGPU, WebGL, TypeGPU, or Three.js host. Nothing in
 * this directory imports a renderer, and nothing here reads a resource: texture or
 * buffer layout stays with the host that owns it.
