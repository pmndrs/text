# Three Flatland Slug audit

Status: research snapshot  
Audited revision: [`c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/tree/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug)  
Audit date: 2026-07-22

This document identifies concrete prior art in `@three-flatland/slug` and assigns a reuse disposition for pmndrs/text. It is not a criticism of the existing package: the current code deliberately targets a smaller problem and is valuable evidence for the new architecture.

## Executive finding

The reusable value is concentrated in the raster pipeline and operational lessons:

- outline normalization to quadratic curves;
- band acceleration and texture packing;
- TSL shader implementation and test references;
- a compact GLB reader using typed-array views;
- baked-first loading with a lazy runtime fallback;
- real-font round-trip tests and measured Slug payload sizes.

The shaping and paragraph paths should be rewritten around HarfRust and source clusters rather than incrementally extended. The current path assumes one UTF-16 code unit maps to one glyph, disables GSUB features to preserve that assumption, stores only explicit pair kerning, and mixes shaping with wrapping/alignment.

## Current architecture

The package currently combines five responsibilities:

1. source font parsing through `opentype.js`;
2. basic cmap/advance/pair-kerning text placement;
3. word wrapping, paragraph measurement, and alignment;
4. Slug curve/band raster generation;
5. Three.js/React rendering objects and loader integration.

The new package should split these into a font compiler, Wasm shaper, JS paragraph engine, raster payloads, and renderer adapters.

## Findings by subsystem

### Shaping: rewrite

The baked shaper in [`textShaperBaked.ts`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/pipeline/textShaperBaked.ts):

- iterates `text.length` and calls `charCodeAt(i)`;
- maps each UTF-16 code unit through a `Uint16Array` cmap;
- uses the JavaScript string index as `srcCharIndex`;
- emits only `{glyphId, srcCharIndex, x, y, scale}`;
- applies one explicit pair-kerning value;
- performs wrapping and alignment inside the same function.

The runtime `opentype.js` path in [`textShaper.ts`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/pipeline/textShaper.ts) explicitly disables `liga` and `rlig`. Its comment explains that substitutions change returned glyph count and break the code's indexing back into `text[i]` for spaces and newlines. This is direct evidence that the one-character/one-glyph contract is the limiting abstraction.

Disposition:

- preserve tests that define current simple-Latin behavior as regression fixtures;
- replace the shaping implementation and output type;
- do not port its combined shape/wrap loop;
- use its baked/runtime equivalence intent, not its algorithm, as prior art.

### cmap and kerning: rewrite representation

[`baked.ts`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/baked.ts) reconstructs two separate `Uint16Array` cmap columns and performs binary search. This excludes scalar values above U+FFFF. Kerning is stored as six-byte triples and `kernLookup` linearly scans every pair for every lookup.

[`bake.ts`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/bake.ts) validates both cmap values and glyph IDs as `u16`, then writes explicit `[left, right, value]` triples. It does not represent class pair positioning or the other GPOS lookup families.

Disposition:

- replace source glyph IDs with dense packed IDs;
- use full scalar cmap plus variation sequences;
- benchmark paged cmap alternatives;
- preserve class positioning rather than expanding it blindly;
- use HarfRust behavior as the reference for GSUB/GPOS/GDEF.

### Paragraph layout: rewrite boundary, retain behavioral fixtures

[`wrapLinesBaked.ts`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/pipeline/wrapLinesBaked.ts) duplicates cmap and kerning traversal, tracks ASCII space and LF explicitly, and slices JavaScript strings by code-unit indices. `shapeTextBaked`, `wrapLinesBaked`, and `textMeasureBaked` each perform related traversal.

This produces deterministic agreement between the package's rendering and measurement paths, which is valuable. It is not sufficient for UAX #14 line breaking, grapheme safety, bidi line ordering, shaped clusters, contextual boundary reshaping, soft hyphens, or ellipsis.

Disposition:

- retain existing simple wrap/measurement examples as compatibility cases;
- centralize broad shaping and measured clusters;
- move break policy and reflow caches into the JS paragraph engine;
- batch boundary-sensitive reshape requests into Wasm.

### Binary GLB reader: port concept, harden contract

[`glb.ts`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/glb.ts) is a small specialized reader that:

- validates GLB magic/version/chunk bounds;
- parses only the JSON and BIN structures it needs;
- returns typed-array views directly over accessor bytes;
- checks accessor bounds against both buffer view and BIN chunk.

This is strong prior art for avoiding a general glTF runtime dependency. The new format needs additional validation for alignment, stride, required sections, integer overflow, overlapping ranges, capability bits, and extension-specific invariants.

Disposition:

- port the narrow-reader philosophy;
- rewrite around `PMNDRS_font` section directories and raster references;
- keep fuzz/corrupt-input tests from the beginning;
- decide whether GPU-oriented sections remain accessors while CPU shaping sections use one custom block.

### Baked object reconstruction: remove

The baked loader reads flat accessors, then [`unpackBaked`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/baked.ts) reconstructs:

- `Map<number, SlugGlyphData>`;
- bounds and location objects per glyph;
- horizontal and vertical band arrays;
- per-band `curveIndices` arrays;
- copied cmap code and glyph arrays.

Curve and band textures themselves are uploaded directly, so the reconstruction is mainly for the shared `SlugGlyphData` runtime model.

Disposition:

- do not port the object graph;
- register flat shared shaping sections with Wasm;
- expose only small JS font/raster handles;
- keep raster metadata in typed views or GPU buffers.

### Slug outline conversion: port with validation

[`fontParser.ts`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/pipeline/fontParser.ts) and the architecture document define these useful behaviors:

- line segments represented as slightly bowed degenerate quadratics to avoid scanline dropout;
- native quadratic segments retained;
- cubics split at `t=0.5` into two quadratic approximations;
- outlines normalized to em space;
- glyph bounds and metrics extracted alongside geometry.

The cubic-to-quadratic approximation needs explicit visual/error tests at extreme scale. The shared new baker should obtain outlines once through the chosen Fontations abstraction and feed the same canonical outline to all generators.

Disposition:

- port the mathematical behavior into a raster-independent Rust generator if licensing permits;
- add approximation-error and pathological-outline fixtures;
- keep source parsing out of the TypeScript runtime path.

### Band acceleration: port and benchmark

[`bandBuilder.ts`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/pipeline/bandBuilder.ts) partitions glyph bounds horizontally and vertically, removes curves that cannot intersect the corresponding ray, and sorts references for shader early exit.

The current architecture documents a default of 16 bands and a maximum of 40 curves per band. These are tuned implementation values rather than general format truths.

Disposition:

- preserve the algorithm and tests as the initial Slug generator candidate;
- store chosen band counts/limits in raster metadata where necessary;
- benchmark font corpus distributions before fixing target v1 limits;
- reject or adapt glyphs that exceed shader/runtime capacity instead of truncating.

### Slug texture packing: port format intent, revisit constraints

[`texturePacker.ts`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/pipeline/texturePacker.ts) already emits GPU-native data:

- RGBA16F curve control points;
- RG32F band headers/references;
- endpoint sharing within contours;
- adjacent-band reference-list deduplication;
- no curve pair crossing a texture row;
- power-of-two texture heights;
- nearest sampling.

This is the strongest direct port candidate. The hard-coded width of 4096 and power-of-two rationale should be revalidated against target WebGPU/WebGL backends and actual compression/upload paths. Integer-valued data stored in floats is a portability tradeoff worth measuring against storage buffers or integer textures in the new renderer matrix.

Disposition:

- port the packing model and shader agreement tests;
- make texture dimensions and formats explicit raster metadata;
- validate all counts/offsets before upload;
- benchmark alternative storage-buffer layout if renderer targets permit it.

### Slug shaders: port with attribution and renderer adapter

The TSL shader modules and CPU reference tests are valuable implementation assets. The project should preserve:

- root eligibility classification;
- quadratic solving and near-linear fallback;
- dual horizontal/vertical coverage;
- fill-rule behavior;
- coverage reference tests;
- pixel-size and dilation behavior.

Disposition:

- keep renderer code outside the shaper and paragraph packages;
- port only after the license/attribution audit is complete;
- maintain CPU reference equations and visual snapshots;
- avoid making Three.js instance layout the canonical font format.

### Loader: port product shape, rewrite fallback

[`SlugFontLoader.ts`](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland/blob/c596ac2313e33cace825fe197a6d730269019175/packages/slug/src/SlugFontLoader.ts) demonstrates:

- a baked-asset-first lookup;
- cached load promises;
- dynamic imports on the runtime path;
- a narrow GLB reader without glTF-Transform in the browser bundle;
- direct `DataTexture` construction from baked texture accessors.

The current fallback fetches and parses the source font on the main thread, parses it through both `parseFont` and `opentype.parse`, then creates a distinct runtime `SlugFont` model instead of canonical baked bytes. A corrupt baked asset silently falls back to runtime parsing.

Disposition:

- preserve baked-first/lazy-heavy-dependency behavior;
- replace fallback with a dynamically loaded runtime baker library that executes in a Worker and returns canonical bytes;
- remove `forceRuntime`; a baked asset miss automatically falls back and emits one development warning with the pre-bake command;
- avoid double source parsing;
- distinguish “baked asset absent” from “baked asset corrupt/incompatible” in diagnostics and policy;
- keep the everyday/direct/preload surface aligned with the eventual pmndrs loader conventions.

The reusable structural pattern extends beyond `SlugFontLoader`: Three Flatland's browser-safe `@three-flatland/bake` root keeps Node discovery/writers behind `/node`, package-specific baker modules behind separate exports, and the standalone/unified CLIs call the same `Baker.run()` implementation. `pmndrs/text` should preserve that host separation while replacing the TypeScript font-domain core with one portable core shared by the Node host and runtime Worker.

## Format observations

The existing `FL_slug_font` format has several good ideas:

- a single baked GLB asset;
- schema version gating;
- named structure-of-arrays columns;
- standard accessors for GPU data;
- an N+1 prefix-sum band index;
- explicit texture format metadata;
- glTF-Transform extension registration for authoring tools.

Constraints to avoid inheriting:

- source rather than dense glyph IDs;
- glyph IDs encoded as `Float32` columns;
- all cmap entries limited to `u16`;
- band offsets encoded as floats;
- flat explicit kerning only;
- raster and shaping data in one Slug-specific extension;
- `extensionsRequired` causing unaware glTF tools to reject the asset even when font data is ignorable to scene processing;
- runtime object reconstruction after reading flat data.

## Existing evidence worth preserving

The package includes valuable test categories:

- real-font pack/unpack equivalence using Inter;
- malformed GLB/accessor validation;
- band builder and texture packer tests;
- shader CPU reference tests;
- baked versus runtime shaping/measurement equivalence;
- paragraph measurement and font-stack behavior.

The README records an Inter Regular Slug-raster baseline:

| Subset | Glyphs |      Raw |   Gzip | Brotli |
| ------ | -----: | -------: | -----: | -----: |
| All    |  2,849 | 12.78 MB | 1.0 MB | 724 KB |
| Latin  |    523 |  2.15 MB | 208 KB | 208 KB |
| ASCII  |     95 |   412 KB |  44 KB |  32 KB |

These numbers are useful only as a snapshot of the existing complete Slug GLB; they do not isolate shaping data from raster data. Future benchmarks must report those sections separately.

## Prior-art reuse order

1. Freeze the current Slug revision used for comparison and retain its tests/fixtures.
2. Establish the new shaped output and packed glyph-ID contracts without rendering.
3. Produce a tiny `PMNDRS_font` with shared metrics plus a revised Slug raster.
4. Compare old and new Slug GPU bytes or rendered output for the same source outlines.
5. Add MSDF and bitmap rasters against the same glyph IDs; the MSDF resource is MTSDF-encoded.
6. Add the worker fallback and prove it emits the same canonical sections.
7. Integrate the JS paragraph engine and renderer adapters.

## Audit follow-ups

- Confirm license and attribution requirements for each file proposed for porting.
- Capture exact shader/band capacity behavior for glyphs exceeding current limits.
- Measure current loader allocations and load time for ASCII, Latin, and full Inter GLBs.
- Determine whether the current cubic approximation is visually acceptable for the broader font corpus.
- Inventory Three Flatland's loader architecture separately before designing the final public loader API.
